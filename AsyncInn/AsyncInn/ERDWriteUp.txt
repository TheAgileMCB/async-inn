Async Inn ERD

The top-most level of the diagram is the Hotels table. This table contains pertinent information for the location of each of Async Inn's locations world-wide. The path then goes to the Rooms table. This table contains information critical to each room, including the room's style, occupancy limit, current availability, price, and whether or not it is pet friendly. The Room table is also associated with a Nickname table through the NicknameId. This allows the rooms to be associated with the flair with which the Async Inn brand has become synonymous. The Room table is also connected to an amenities table, wherein amenities are enumerated and described as they apply to each room. The company also maintains a Guest table, which holds pertinent information for guests who choose or have chosen to stay with Async Inn. There is also a Booking table, where up-to-date information is held about guests' stays, including when they arrived, when they intend to depart, and how many are in their party. This table is identified by a composite key in order to most appropriately group the records.
